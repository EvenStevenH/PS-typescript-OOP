## Reflection

The type of variables can change over the course of an object-oriented program's execution in vanilla JavaScript, a dynamically typed language, and cause unexpected behaviors if not handled properly. TypeScript enforces type safety allowing you to declare variable types explicitly, thus reducing the chance of unexpected type-related errors by catching them at compile time in lieu of runtime. After having set it up for this project, I made `PhysicalProduct` and `DigitalProduct` classes `extend` from `Product`, allowing them to call the parent class's constructor method and inherit `_sku`, `name`, and `price` through `super`. If I had to add a new type of product (ex. SubscriptionProduct), this kind of polymorphism would make this extension straightforward. Within my setup, I also used encapsulation and access modifiers control the visibility of properties and methods, such as `private` for `_sku` (no access outside the `Product` class) and `public` for the product's `name` and `price` (access everywhere). `Protected`, while not used this time, would allow access within subclasses.
